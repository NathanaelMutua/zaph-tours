## Logic & Implementation

- **Data-Driven UI:**

  - Destinations, trip packages, and testimonials are stored as arrays of objects in the `/src/data` directory.
  - Components use `.filter()` to display only featured items and `.map()` to render lists dynamically.

- **Responsive Design:**

  - MUI‚Äôs Grid and Stack components ensure layouts adapt to all device sizes.
  - Responsive props and `sx` objects are used for breakpoints.

- **Theming:**

  - Custom theme in `/src/assets/theme.ts` sets primary/secondary colors, background, text, and card elevation.
  - Typography and palette are consistently applied via the `ThemeProvider`.

- **UI Logic Highlights:**
  - Navbar is fixed and content is padded to avoid overlap.
  - Cards use MUI‚Äôs elevation and chips for visual emphasis.
  - Star ratings in testimonials are rendered dynamically based on the review‚Äôs rating.
  - Trip Package ratings are also generated dynamicallty based on the review's rating.

---

## UI/UX

- **Modern, Clean Look:**

  - Consistent use of MUI‚Äôs design system for a professional appearance.
  - Cards, chips, and buttons provide clear calls to action.

- **Accessibility:**

  - Enough color contrast and font sizes.

- **Animations & Effects:**
  - Card images scale on hover for interactivity.
